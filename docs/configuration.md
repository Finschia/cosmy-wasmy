| `cosmywasmy.chains`  | json   | Juno UNI-5, Juno, Osmosis test-4, Osmosis, Archway constantine-1 config | Application | This setting stores an array of JSON objects which contains the Chain config details. <br /> This setting can be expanded to include any localnet or testnet chains (_mainnet not recommended_). <br/> The structure of the expected setting is elaborated below this table  |
| `cosmywasmy.contractSortOrder` | enum   | None | Workspace | This setting controls the sorting order of the Smart Contracts in the Contract view <br /> * Alphabetical - Sort the Smart Contracts alphabetically by their label<br /> * CodeId - Sort the Smart Contracts by the Code ID<br /> * None - No explicit sorting - Maintains the order the contracts were imported in |
