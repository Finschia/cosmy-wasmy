# cosmy-wasmy 

This extension allows you to interact with Cosmwasm contracts on local, testnet or mainnet chains

## Requirements

The version of vscode should be above `^1.67.0`

## Extension Settings

**[Juno uni-3 testnet](https://testnet.ping.pub/juno)** config and **[Juno Localnet](https://github.com/CosmosContracts/juno/pkgs/container/juno)** config is preset by default. Any other chain can be manually added.

You can set up the extension settings here 
> File > Preferences > Settings > Cosmy Wasmy

This extension contributes the following settings:
* `cosmywasmy.chainConfigName`: This setting is used to select which of the given Chain configs is to be used in this workspace. Default: _Juno UNI-3 testnet_ 
* `cosmywasmy.chains`: This settings stores an array of JSON objects which contans the Chain config details. Default: Includes _Juno UNI-3 testnet_ and _Juno Localnet docker_ settings.

    This setting can be expanded to include any localnet or testnet chains. (Mainnet not recommended)

    The structure of the expected setting:
    ```json
    [
        {
            "configName": "Juno UNI-3 testnet", // This need to match exactly the `cosmywasmy.chainConfigName` when the chain config needs to be selected
            "chainId": "uni-3", // The localnet/testnet Chain ID
            "addressPrefix": "juno", // Used to derive account address
            "rpcEndpoint": "https://rpc.uni.juno.deuslabs.fi", // Used for query and tx exec of smart contracts
            "defaultGasPrice": "0.025", // Gas price set for the smart contract tx execution
            "chainDenom": "ujunox" // the micro denom used to pay for gas and to track account balance
        }
    ]
    ```
